# Rock Paper Scissors
### Created by `Arthur Munhoz`

## Description
As a version of the famous <b>Rock Paper Scissor</b> game, this project was developed as a challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor (find out about other challenges at: [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges))<br>.
The reason I've chosen this challenge in specific, was to be able to learn and practice some new stuff such as <b>StyledComponents</b> and <b>Animations with GSAP</b> ([https://greensock.com/react/](https://greensock.com/react/)).
